We present and analyze a control variate strategy based on couplings to reduce the variance of finite difference estimators of sensitivity coefficients, called transport coefficients in the physics literature. We study the bias and variance of a sticky-coupling and a synchronous-coupling based estimator as the finite difference parameter $\eta$ goes to zero.
