I am a Post-Doc at ESSEC Business School working with [Pierre Jacob](https://pierrejacob.org/) and funded by the ERC [UMCMC] (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101171415) project (Markov Chain Monte Carlo using couplings toward scalable statistical inference).

Previously, I was a PhD Student at CERMICS École des Ponts advised by [Gabriel Stoltz](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/gabriel-stoltz/) and [Stefano Olla](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~olla/) (CEREMADE Université Paris-Dauphine) funded by the ANR [SINEQ](https://sites.google.com/view/aleiac/anr-sineq) (SImulating NonEQuilibrium stochastic dynamics) project. During my PhD, I was additionally part of the Inria [MATHERIALS](https://team.inria.fr/matherials/) (MATHematics for MathERIALS) team.
